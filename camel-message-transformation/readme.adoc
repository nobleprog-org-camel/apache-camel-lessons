 - As we discussed during enterprise integration introduction that different systems can have different format and protocol
    for communicating with them, so message transformation is needed in case camel application need to communicate with them.
 - When we recieve any message from producer we consume it and transform into a structure which represents that message into our
   data model.
 - For eg. external systems might place orders in file in xml structure and we need to process that order and send it to another
    system which expects data in the json format.


- Next we see how camel message-translator works
